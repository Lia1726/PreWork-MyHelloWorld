## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- One of my emulations was not popping up for some reason, but I resolved it by creating a new one. I think my computer could have been running slow
- When I was changing the button colors, I was struggling to change it from the default purple. The solution I found was to change Button to androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatButton.
